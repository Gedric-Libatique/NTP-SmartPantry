# Smart Pantry Management System

## Overview
The Smart Pantry Management System is an innovative project that aims to prevent food waste in large storage rooms, such as public food pantries. It utilizes machine learning, camera technology, and an interactive user interface to efficiently manage inventory and reduce food waste.

### Key Features
- Machine learning camera for item detection and expiration date retrieval.
- Object shape detection for optimized storage.
- User-friendly interactive screen for easy management.
- Local database for tracking item locations and expiration dates.
